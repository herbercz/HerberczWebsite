    <p>The website is obviously made by Herbercz</p>

    It was made as a lesson in his HTML course. Herbercz is a young man born in 2009 who is interested in programming,
    he started programming when he was 11/12 years old. His first programming language was python, but he quickly have
    up and switched to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So yeah, this website is just for a lesson and will be
    probably never published. There will be a picture under this text. <br>
